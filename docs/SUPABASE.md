# Using Supabase (optional)

You can point `DATABASE_URL` to Supabase Postgres. Create a new project, copy the connection string, and run `db/schema.sql` and `db/seed.sql` in the SQL editor.

For authentication/email, this starter already implements magic links via Resend/SendGrid; you may disable Supabase Auth entirely.
